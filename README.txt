First thing we did was implement the layouts. This took each of us about 2-3 hours because we had to collaborate and figure out which layout is best.
Next, we implemented some basic functionality. This meant adding a food (initially not connected to any database). We just used an arraylist initially to hold different food item data. This took 3-4 hours because we ran into some unexpected errors (namely, setText(int) being a valid method in the EditText and TextView class, but crashing... we had to convert ints/doubles to strings first to fix this).
Next, we wrote out the different formulas that we needed and put them in a separate class. This only took about 20 minutes.
Next, we implemented the profile page and decided to use the shared preferences file. This took about 1.5-2 hours. 
Next, we did the database. We decided to make an autoincrement id as the key. This database file FoodDB took about 2 hours to write due to a few random typos in the SQL.
Next, we connected the database to the add/delete/edit food functionality. This took the longest because we had to change how we wrote it initially. This took maybe 5 hours total.
After we connected the database, we were mostly done. We then chose to implement different date functionality. This involved figuring out how date pickers worked which took a longer time due to an annoying bug trying to get the default date to be the current date. Maybe about 3 hours.
Finally, we just had to do some final touch ups such as the loading screen, new app icon and the profile icon.

This is the food tracking app we made for our final project for the android course. Functionality includes: calories tracking and an embedded database using SQLite to hold info about the foods including name, calories, and other macronutrients. Additionally, the user is allowed to choose which day their food is to be added to so that they can keep track of what they eat on a day-to-day basis.
